## How to Use

### Starting Your Story
- Begin naturally—Trinity adapts to your narrative
- Initial temperature: 1 (Introduction phase)
- Heat builds automatically based on content

### Building Tension
- Describe attraction, longing looks, lingering touches
- Words like "desire," "need," "ache" increase heat
- Temperature rises gradually: Introduction → Rising Action → Climax

### Reaching Climax
- Temperature 10-12 is ideal for intimate scenes
- Use `@temp 11` to manually enter peak intimacy
- Overheat mode activates after sustained high temp (maintains intensity)

### Afterglow & Resolution
- Cooldown phase automatically follows overheat
- Temperature decreases gradually
- Focus shifts to tenderness, emotion, bonding

### Manual Control
- `@req more emotional depth`: Immediate adjustment
- `(slowly build to first kiss)`: Multi-turn goal
- `@temp 8`: Set rising tension
- `@arc climax`: Jump to climax phase

## Story Card Configuration

### PlayersAuthorsNote
Your persistent author's note. Examples:
```
Focus on sensory details and emotional interiority.
Characters: Alex (confident, teasing) and Jordan (shy, responsive).
Tone: Slow burn romance with explicit intimacy.
```

### banned_words (PRECISE Removal)
Exact phrases to remove from output:
```
I'm sorry, but, it seems, as an AI, against my programming
```

### aggressive_removal (AGGRESSIVE Removal)
Remove entire sentences containing these phrases:
```
content policy, inappropriate, explicit content
```

### word_replacer (Manual Synonyms)

```

## Temperature Guide

| Temp | Phase | Focus | Example Scene |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1-3 | Introduction | Meet, attraction | First conversation, stolen glances |
| 4-6 | Rising (Early) | Tension builds | Accidental touches, flirting |
| 7-9 | Rising (Late) | Desire intensifies | Charged moments, restraint breaking |
| 10 | Climax Entry | Point of no return | First kiss, clothes coming off |
| 11-12 | Peak Climax | Full intimacy | Sex scene, emotional vulnerability |
| 13-15 | Extreme | Overwhelming | Multiple orgasms, intense passion |
| OH | Overheat | Sustained peak | Extended intimacy, deep connection |
| CD | Cooldown | Afterglow | Tender touches, quiet confessions |

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Let tension build naturally
- Use commands sparingly for major redirects
- Trust the NGO system to pace your story
- Embrace genre-appropriate vocabulary
- Focus on character emotion and sensation

### DON'T:
- Manually force temperature too high too fast
- Overuse @req commands (breaks immersion)
- Fight the system—work with narrative flow
- Worry about repetition of anatomical terms (they're whitelisted)

## Advanced Tips

### Prolonging Tension
- Keep temperature 7-9 for extended "almost" moments
- Use calming words to prevent premature escalation
- Build emotional barriers that slow physical progression

### Enhanced Climax Scenes
- Let temperature reach 11-12 naturally
- Overheat mode will sustain intensity for 4 turns
- Mix physical action with emotional vulnerability

### Emotional Depth
- Use PlayersAuthorsNote to define character voices
- Request emotional interiority: `@req focus on Alex's conflicted feelings`
- Cooldown phase is perfect for character development

### Customization
- Edit conflict/calming word lists in sharedLibrary for your specific story
- Adjust heat thresholds if pacing feels too fast/slow
- Use word_replacer card to match your preferred terminology

## BDSM Content Support

Trinity Scripts fully supports BDSM content with specialized features:

### Power Dynamics
- Words like "dominate," "submit," "control" increase heat
- Role terms (dom, sub, master, etc.) are whitelisted (won't flag as repetitive)
- Commands work great for scenes: `@req establish dom/sub dynamic`

### Aftercare Support
- Aftercare terms ("care," "check," "reassure") trigger calming
- Cooldown phase is perfect for aftercare scenes
- Safety terms (safeword, consent, boundary) are whitelisted

### Equipment & Scenes
- BDSM equipment terms increase tension appropriately
- All gear vocabulary whitelisted (collar, cuff, rope, etc.)
- Action terms (bind, spank, discipline) drive heat naturally

## Troubleshooting

**Story feels repetitive:**
- Bonepoke will auto-replace fatigued words
- Check if quality thresholds are too strict (Config: use "balanced" preset)

**Temperature rising too fast:**
- Reduce use of conflict words
- Add calming words to slow pacing
- Consider that heat threshold is set for slower burn (10)

**Temperature stuck:**
- Increase romantic/sexual content in your inputs
- Use `@temp [number]` to manually adjust
- Check that heat isn't decaying too quickly (set to 0.5 for slower decay)

**Output too tame/too explicit:**
- Adjust AI model settings (not script-controlled)
- Use banned_words/aggressive_removal to filter
- Guide with PlayersAuthorsNote and @req commands
