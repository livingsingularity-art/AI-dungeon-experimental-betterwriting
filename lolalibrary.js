    * 
    * 1. Object Mode:
    *    Pass a single object containing card request parameters. The only mandatory property is "title"
    *    All other properties are optional and customize the card generation
    * 
    *    Example:

    *      type: "character",         // The category or type of the card; defaults to "class" if omitted
    *      title: "Leah the Lewd",    // The card's title (required)

    *      entryStart: "You are a woman named Leah.", // Existing content to prepend to the AI-generated entry
    *      entryPrompt: "",           // Global prompt guiding AI content generation
    *      entryPromptDetails: "Focus on Leah's works of artifice and ingenuity", // Additional prompt info
    *      entryLimit: 750,           // Target character length for the AI-generated entry
    *      description: "Player character!", // Freeform notes
    *      memoryStart: "Leah purchased a new sweater.", // Existing memory content
    *      memoryUpdates: true,       // Whether the card's memory bank will update on its own
    *      memoryLimit: 2750          // Preferred memory bank size before summarization/compression
    *    });
    * 
    * 2. String Mode:
    *    Pass a string as the title and optionally two additional strings to specify prompt details
    *    This mode is shorthand for quick card generation without an explicit card request object
    * 
    *    Examples:

    *    AutoCards().API.generateCard("Leah the Lewd", "Focus on Leah's works of artifice and ingenuity");

    *      "Focus on Leah's works of artifice and ingenuity",
    *      "You are a woman named Leah."

    * @param {string} [extra2] Optional entry start text when using string mode
