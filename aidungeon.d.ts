/**
 * AI Dungeon Scripting API type definitions.
 *
 * @author Worldsmythe
 *
 * @remarks
 * This file defines the global types available in AI Dungeon scripts.
 * Scripts run in three lifecycle hooks:
 *
 * - `onInput`: Modify player's input before constructing model context
 * - `onModelContext`: Change the text sent to the AI model before generation
 * - `onOutput`: Modify the model's output before showing it to the player
 *
 * The modifier scripts are expected to look like this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const modifier = (text) => {
 *
 *   let modifiedText = text
 *
 *   // The text passed in is either the user's input or players output to modify.
 *   if(text.includes('grab a sword')) {
 *
 *     // You can modify the state variable to keep track of state throughout the adventure
 *     state.items = ['sword']
 *
 *     // Setting state.memory.context will cause that to be used instead of the user set memory
 *     state.memory = {context: 'You have a sword.'}
 *
 *     // Setting state.message will set an info message that will be displayed in the game
 *     state.message = 'You got a sword!'
 *
 *     // You can log things to the side console when testing with console.log
 *     console.log('Added a sword to player')
 *
 *     modifiedText = text + '\nYou also now have a sword!'
 *   }
 *
 *   // You must return an object with the text property defined.
 *   return {text: modifiedText}
 * }
 *
 * // Don't modify this part
 * modifier(text)
 * ```
 *
 * Each script run is independent - memory is not shared between runs.
 * Use the `state` object to persist data between turns.
 *
 * Context structure:
 * ```
 * [AI instructions]
 * [Plot essentials]
 * World Lore:
 * [Story cards injected here]
 *
 * Story Summary:
 * [Summary content]
 *
 * Memories:
 * [Story's memories or the value of state.memory.context, if set]
 *
 * Recent Story:
 * [History actions]
 * [Author's note or the value of state.memory.authorsNote, if set]
 * [Last AI response or player action]
 * [The value of state.memory.frontMemory]
 * ```
 *
 * Story cards are injected into the context when their keys match content in
 * the recent story separated by a newline.
 *
 * Story card format:
 * ```
 * World Lore:
 * [Story card content]
 *
 * [Additional card content]
 * ```

   * @remarks
   * For `onInput`:
   * - Returning empty string throws error shown to player
   * - Returned text replaces player's input
   *
   * For `onModelContext`:
   * - Returning empty string causes context to build as if script didn't run
   * - Returned text replaces the entire context sent to AI
   *
   * For `onOutput`:
   * - Returning empty string throws error shown to player
   * - Returned text replaces AI's output
   *
   * When `stop` is true, the game loop halts (generally triggers errors).
